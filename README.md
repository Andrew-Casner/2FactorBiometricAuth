# Consentsus
SDHacks 2018 Hack

Privacy is becoming a more important issue every day. All of us have had that experience where someone else posted an unflattering picture of us on Facebook for everyone to see. Now take that up a notch, who would want a casual photo from a walk in the park to end up in a tabloid? We all care about our privacy, and more importantly, we care about safety. Consentsus allows people to know and be in control of when their photos are released, and even allows parents to sign off for their children's photos as well. Through Consentsus, photographers can ethically manage photo release rights through a scalable platform.
